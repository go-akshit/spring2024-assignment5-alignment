Multiprocessing can also be more efficient than threading in certain cases, such as when the code being executed is CPU-intensive. However, threading can be more efficient than multiprocessing in cases where the code being executed is I/O-intensive, as threads can wait for I/O operations to complete without blocking other threads. As for your second question, the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is a mechanism in Python that ensures that only one thread can execute Python code at a time, which can limit the performance of threaded programs.

Mathematics has itself been described as an art motivated by beauty. Mathematics can be discerned in arts such as music, dance, painting, architecture, sculpture, and textiles. This article focuses, however, on mathematics in the visual arts.\nMathematics and art have a long historical relationship. Artists have used mathematics since the 4th century BC when the Greek sculptor Polykleitos wrote his Canon, prescribing proportions conjectured to have been based on the ratio 1:\u221a2 for the ideal male nude. Persistent popular claims have been made for the use of the golden ratio in ancient art and architecture, without reliable evidence. In the Italian Renaissance, Luca Pacioli wrote the influential treatise De divina proportione (1509), illustrated with woodcuts by Leonardo da Vinci, on the use of the golden ratio in art. Another Italian painter, Piero della Francesca, developed Euclid's ideas on perspective in treatises such as De Prospectiva Pingendi, and in his paintings. The engraver Albrecht D\u00fcrer made many references to mathematics in his work Melencolia I. In modern times, the graphic artist M. C. Escher made intensive use of tessellation and hyperbolic geometry, with the help of the mathematician H. S. M. Coxeter, while the De Stijl movement led by Theo van Doesburg and Piet Mondrian explicitly embraced geometrical forms. Mathematics has inspired textile arts such as quilting, knitting, cross-stitch, crochet, embroidery, weaving, Turkish and other carpet-making, as well as kilim.

In this paper, we focus on the FSL problem of dialogue understanding, which contains two closely related tasks: intent detection and slot filling. Dialogue understanding has been proven to benefit a lot from jointly learning the two sub-tasks. However, such joint learning becomes challenging in the few-shot scenarios: on the one hand, the sparsity of samples greatly magnifies the difficulty of modeling the connection between the two tasks; on the other hand, how to jointly learn multiple tasks in the few-shot setting is still less investigated. In response to this, we introduce FewJoint, the first FSL benchmark for joint dialogue understanding. FewJoint provides a new corpus with 59 different dialogue domains from real industrial API and a code platform to ease FSL experiment set-up, which are expected to advance the research of this field. Further, we find that insufficient performance of the few-shot setting often leads to noisy sharing between two sub-task and disturbs joint learning. To tackle this, we guide slot with explicit intent information and propose a novel trust gating mechanism that blocks low-confidence intent information to ensure high quality sharing. Besides, we introduce a Reptile-based meta-learning strategy to achieve better generalization in unseen few-shot domains. In the experiments, the proposed method brings significant improvements on two datasets and achieve new state-of-the-art performance.", "dataset": "selfinstruct", "output": "The paper focuses on the problem of few-shot learning (FSL) in dialogue understanding, specifically intent detection and slot filling.

This means that a single snowflake can potentially cover an area of up to 1 square inch on the ground. If we assume that a typical snowflake falls at a rate of 1 inch per hour, then we can estimate that a single snowflake can cover an area of 1 square inch in one hour. If we extrapolate this to a typical winter, we can estimate that a single snowflake can cover an area of 1 square inch in one hour, and if we assume that there are 24 hours in a day, then we can estimate that a single snowflake can cover an area of 24 square inches in a day. If we further assume that there are 30 days in a typical winter, then we can estimate that a single snowflake can cover an area of 720 square inches in a typical winter.
